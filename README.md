# Arduino-Projects
These are a couple of the projects I built using Ardunio. Each folder is a different project.
Some of the projects include
A robot that uses a echo location(Pingsensor/ Servo)to create a map on a screen and move without running into anything 
A robot that uses IR sensors inorder to never fall off a table
A robot that goes straight for a certain distance based off the input
